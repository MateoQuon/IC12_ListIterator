LinkedList: Scattered about RAM, backed by Nodes, may only be <E> (Reference Types (starts w/ capitals))
ListIterator: data structure that traverses lists and allows concurrent modification
(bypasses ConcurrentModificationException) and allows bi-directional traversal.
Arraylist cannot modify lists during a loop
